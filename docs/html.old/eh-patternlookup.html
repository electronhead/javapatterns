<font color="#000080"><font size=+2>Introduction</font></font></h2>
This page introduces the <a href="patterns/packages.html#_top_">JavaPatternLookup
(JPL) api</a>, a collection of classes that enables Java programs to dynamically
access [in-memory] data and invoke methods using rule-based data patterns.You
define these data patterns in terms of the classes and objects of your
application. Dynamic access is provided without any pre- or post-processing
of source or class files.
<p>Inspirations for JPL include the multi-method dispatch policies of the
Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) and the Lisp derivative, Dylan. If you
are familiar with either CLOS, Dylan, or any other language that supports
run-time method resolution based on the actual (vs. formal) types of all
(vs. some) parameters, then you will already be somewhat familiar with
the concepts presented here. For Java programmers, the corresponding analog
would be if the part of method dispatch policy involving run-time types
were extended to include all objects in the method's parameter list instead
of just the run-time type of the receiving object.
<p>JPL implements the dynamic selection policies of the above-mentioned
languages and extends them by using logical implication instead of type-resolution.
Logical implication provides more flexibility when defining patterns. Furthermore,
JPL's implementation of logical implication enables the developer to define
additional types of rules that participate in logical implication.
<p>When you are creating software that must in some way dynamically react
to patterns of information, JPL can provide the means to organize and execute
your application's responses.

The root class of the <a href="patterns/packages.html#_top_">api</a> is
PatternDAG, from which the main classes in JPL derive as follows:

<h2>
<a NAME="familiar starting point"></a><font color="#000066">A Starting
Point</font></h2>
To get an idea of how a PatternDAG works, consider the familiar data structure
implemented in the Java class, <tt>java.util.Hashtable</tt>. Hashtables
let you store and access an object, the <i>value</i>, based on the value
of another object, the <i>key</i>. To associate a key object, <tt>k</tt>,
with a value object, <tt>v</tt>, using the Hashtable, <tt>h</tt>, you apply
<tt>Hashtable</tt>'s
put method as follows:&nbsp; <tt>h.put (k, v)</tt>. To access the value
associated with <tt>k</tt>, you apply the get method as follows: <tt>h.get
(k)</tt>.
<p><tt>K k = new K();</tt>
<br><tt>V v = new V();</tt>
<br><tt>Hashtable h = new Hashtable();</tt>
<br><tt>h.put(k,v);</tt>
<br><tt>V v2 = (V)h.get(k);</tt>
<br><tt>v == v2 // returns true</tt>
<p>Now suppose that you requre more flexibility in specifying the key part
of the Hashtable. Let's say that you need to retrieve V, except that you
would rather base the value lookup on the class of the key instead of the
key itself -- similar to how methods are selected polymorphically for execution
in Java and in other languages. Hashtables would not fit the bill; <tt>h.put
(K.class, v)</tt> would not result in the desired access using <tt>k</tt>
or other instances of <tt>K</tt> as keys later on.
<p>To achieve this sort of functionality, one can use a PatternTree, a
sub-class of PatternDAG. The following code illustrates the point:
<p><tt>PatternTree pt = new PatternTree (new RuleProxy[]{XT.x});</tt>
<br><tt>pt.put (new Rule[]{XT.<u>of</u>(K.class)},v);</tt>
<br><tt>V v2 = (V)pt.get(new Object[]{k});</tt>
<br><tt>K k2 = new K();</tt>
<br><tt>V v3 = (V)pt.get(new Object[]{k2});</tt>
<p><tt>v == v2 // returns true</tt>
<br><tt>v2 == v3 // returns true</tt>
<p>The first line creates a PatternTree using an array of RuleProxy objects.
The RuleProxy object tells the PatternTree what type of rule can and will
be used in the RuleProxy's position in a pattern. In this case, the first
and only element of a pattern can be a rule that corresponds to the XT
type of rule. <b>[In general, a pattern is defined using an array of rules.]</b>
<p>The next line of code associates a pattern represented by an array with
one rule in it, namely, <tt>XT.of (K.class)</tt>, with a value. Taking
the method name, <tt>of</tt>, as a clue, this rule returns true if the
corresponding object in a supplied pattern is an instance of <tt>K</tt>.
<b>[In
general, a rule takes a value and returns either <tt>true</tt> or
<tt>false.]</tt></b>
<p>The next line of code selects the value in <tt>pt</tt> corresponding
to the pattern, <tt>new Object [] {k}</tt>. Since <tt>k</tt> is an instance
of <tt>K</tt>, the value returned, as in the case of the following lines,
is <tt>v</tt>.
<p>Let's now say that you need also to select values based on key equality
(as in the Hashtable example) in addition to selection based on class membership.
In terms of the above example, the following code illustrates how to select
<tt>v4</tt>
based on <tt>k3</tt>, a particular instance of <tt>K</tt>, and select <tt>v</tt>
for other all other instances of <tt>K</tt>.
<p><tt>K k3 = new K();</tt>
<br><tt>V v4 = new V();</tt>
<br><tt>pt.put (new Rule[]{XT.<u>is</u>(k3)},v4);</tt>
<p><tt>v == (V)pt.get(new Object[]{k}) // returns true</tt>
<br><tt>v == (V)pt.get(new Object[]{new K()}) // returns true</tt>
<br><tt>v4 == (V)pt.get(new Object[]{k3}) // returns true</tt>
<p>Why did <tt>pt.get(...)</tt> return <tt>v4</tt> in the last line above?
<p>Before answering, first note that because XT.x is the RuleProxy of interest,
JPL views the pattern defined by <tt>new Object [] {k}</tt> as a short-hand
equivalent to the pattern defined by <tt>new Rule [] {XT.is (k)}</tt>.
JPL actually deals with rules and not values; values are transformed into
their corresponding RuleProxy's <i>instance rule</i>.
<p>As you may recall from the introduction, pattern matching uses logical
implication among rules to determine which value to select. <b>[A rule
M&nbsp; implies another rule N if and only if for every value of v where
M(v) == true, then N(v) == true.]</b>
<p>From the example we have two possible candidates: the rule involving
the "of" method and the rule involving the "is" method. In general, <b>JPL
will pick the least general rule among all rules in the PatternTree which
are implied by the incoming pattern</b>. The least general rule for a pattern
is the rule that [1] is implied by the supplied pattern's equivalent rule
and [2] is not implied by any other rule in the PatternTree (and hence
least).
<p>So because [a] <tt>k3</tt>'s corresponding instance rule is <tt>XT.is(k3)</tt>,
[b] any rule implies itself, and [c] <tt>XT.of(K.class)</tt> does not imply
<tt>XT.is(k3)</tt>,
the result is <tt>v4</tt> and not <tt>v</tt>.
<p>The above PatternTree uses a rule list of length one, just as there
is one key element used in looking up Hashtable values. But more likely
than not, you will define PatternDAGs using rules lists of length greater
than one. In addition, you will define rules involving the Java class/sub-class
hierarchy and choose from different rule types.
